# Current-Portfolio

This repo contains corynko's (Ethan Kotel's) current developer's portfolio.

## What Is It

A clean, functional portfolio that communicates what it needs to. A was searching for a calm and clean aesthetic that still contains all of the necessary functionality, with a dark, earthy color palette and subtle animations.

## Where Is It

You can view my current portfolio at [corynko.github.io/current-portfolio](https://corynko.github.io/Current-Portfolio).

## Who Can Use It

All of the photos on this page currently are the intellectual property of Ethan Kotel Photography, LLC and may not be used for profit without permission, or for free without credit.

## Known Issues

There is still quite a bit of work to do to get it up to the design standards I typically lay out for myself. That will be in the next iteration. I also need to do some tweaking of my headshot to get it to behave properly on mobile, next update as well.
